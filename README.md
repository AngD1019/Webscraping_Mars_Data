# Webscraping Mars Data

## Project Objective

The objective of this project is to scrape, organize, analyze, and visualize the data related to Mars news articles and Mars weather information. This was to be done by extracting an HTML table into a Pandas DataFrame, then using Pandas and Beautiful Soup to scrape the data. 

## Project Deliverables

* Deliverable 1: A Jupyter notebook containing code that scrapes the Mars news titles and preview text.

* Deliverable 2: A Jupyter notebook containing code that scrapes the Mars weather data and that cleans, visualizes, and analyzes that data.

The weather dataframe was exported into a CSV file and was uploaded into github.
